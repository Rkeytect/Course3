2. Read the 3 tables(subject_,X_,y_*) for test set and training set
3. Combine the data sets using rbind and cbind into one complete data set
4. Rename the columns and activity levels using features.txt and activity_lables.txt
5. Extract the columns with mean() and std() in their columnnames
6. Label the data sets with descriptive names
7. Creates a tidy dataset with mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
